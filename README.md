# Web Voice Assistant

This is a starter template for [LiveKit Agents](https://docs.livekit.io/agents) that provides a simple voice interface using the [LiveKit JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-js). It supports [voice](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/voice-ai), [transcriptions](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/text/), and [virtual avatars](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/avatar).

This template is built with Next.js and is free for you to use or modify as you see fit.

## Getting started

> [!TIP]
> If you'd like to try this application without modification, you can deploy an instance in just a few clicks with [LiveKit Cloud Sandbox](https://cloud.livekit.io/projects/p_/sandbox/templates/voice-assistant-frontend).

Run the following command to automatically clone this template.

```bash
lk app create --template voice-assistant-frontend
```

Then run the app with:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

And open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

You'll also need an agent to speak with. Try our [Voice AI Quickstart](https://docs.livekit.io/start/voice-ai) for the easiest way to get started.

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to modify the LiveKit project credentials used, you can edit `.env.local` (copy from `.env.example` if you don't have one) to suit your needs.

## Password Protection

This application includes password protection to restrict access to authorized users. To set up the password:

1. Create or edit your `.env.local` file and add:
   ```
   APP_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
   ```

2. Replace `your_secure_password` with a strong password of your choice.

3. Restart the application for the changes to take effect.

When users visit the application, they will be redirected to a login page where they must enter the correct password to access the app.
